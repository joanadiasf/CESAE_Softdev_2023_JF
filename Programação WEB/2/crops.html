    <h6>Crops</h6>

    </div>

    <p>Crops are plants that are grown from seeds to be harvested for the purpose of profit,
      food, or gifting. Generally, each crop is seasonal. It can be planted only during its
      designated season, and when seasons change (after the 28th day), the crop will wither and die.
      Multi-season crops (i.e.,Ancient Fruit, Coffee Bean, Corn, Sunflower, and Wheat), however,
      will continue to grow during all specified seasons.

      <br>
      <br>

      If planting on the first of a season, a 5-day crop will be ready for harvest on day 6, not day 5. In this case,
      the number may be thought of as the number of nights required to grow the crop.
      Fertilizer and the Agriculturist Profession are not taken into account on this page, but the effects can be viewed
      on individual crop pages.
      Crops must be watered every day for maximum growth. If unwatered for a day, a crop will not grow. Unwatered crops
      do not die, but they will not grow either.
      If a seed is planted into unwatered soil and not watered the same day, it will not grow that night. Growth will
      start the following night. The grow times on this page assume the seeds are watered the day they are planted.
      Planting after midnight does not impose a penalty (it still counts as having been planted on the current day).
    </p>



    <h6>End of Season</h6>

    <div class="floatleft2">
      <img alt="Giant melon" src="crops/Giant_Melon.png" decoding="async" width="83" height="105">
    </div>

    <p>On the 1st of each season, all crops that are no longer in season will wither and die, leaving behind a dead
      crop. When a dead crop is left behind at the start of a season it will keep the soil it was planted on tilled,
      which can reduce the amount of manual tilling and watering that needs to be done at the start of a season. Dead
      crops can be removed with a scythe.

      Multi-season crops that are still in season (i.e., corn planted in summer when transitioning into fall) will not
      wither and will simply continue to grow. Fully grown crops that are ready to harvest will wither and die when
      moving to a new season, however.</p>
